#### Development

Use this command in the same directory with the [package.json](https://github.com/tadachi/multi-twitch-chat/blob/master/package.json) file to install all the dependencies to get the node dev server working.

```bash
npm install
```

To get the server running,

```bash
node dev-server.js
...
Listening on port: 4000
hostname: localhost:4000
```

For me, I would enter http://mtc.tak.com:4000 into my browser to use/test the app. You would use another host name or try http://localhost:4000 .
